# freecodecamp_guide
A guide to free code camp complete with schedule.

Run "npm run user" to create a new user and get started.

Run "npm run status" to view current or upcoming assignments.
 
Run "npm run start" to start an assignment and "npm run stop" to finish or pause.

Run "npm run commands" to see a list of commands.

Right now, there is only a week's worth of assignments (1/day). But more will be added later!
